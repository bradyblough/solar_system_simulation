# Solar System Simulation

Welcome to the Solar System Simulation! This project lets you explore the motion of planets in our solar system using the SFML graphics library and C++. Witness the beauty of planetary orbits and movements in a visually engaging way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you dive into the simulation, ensure you have the SFML library installed on your system. If not, you can conveniently download it from [SFML's official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the simulation on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-simulation.git
   cd solar-system-simulation
   ```

## Compilation and Running

Compile and run the simulation with these easy steps:

1. Build the project:

   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o sim -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
   ```

2. Execute the compiled simulation:

   ```sh
   ./simulation
   ```

## Usage

Once you run the simulation, a window will display the sun and planets in motion. Immerse yourself in observing the intricate orbits and graceful movements of the planets.

## Features

- Realistic simulation based on Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
- Visual representation of planets' orbits and dynamic movements.
- Informative labels indicating the names of each planet.
- Day counter to track the passage of time within the simulation.
